= Booleanize

Booleanize is a Ruby on Rails plugin that adds new methods to help you work with your models' boolean attributes. Basically, it creates two new instance methods and two named scopes for each specified boolean attribute.

== Instance Methods

Suppose you have a boolean attribute called <tt>active</tt> inside a User model. If you pass the name of this attribute for the booleanize, two new methods will be created: 

* <tt>active?</tt> - Returns if the attribute's value is <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>
* <tt>active_humanize</tt> - Returns a string representing each of the <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> values.

=== Examples

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    booleanize :active
  end
  
  u = User.new(:active => true)
  u.active? #=> true
  u.active = false
  u.active_humanize #=> "True"
  u.active? #=> false
  u.active_humanize #=> "False"
  
You can also specify which strings Booleanize should use for each of the <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt> values, by passing an array with the format [:attr_name, "string for true", "string for false"].

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    booleanize [:active, "Yes", "No"]
  end
  
  u = user.new(:active => true)
  u.active_humanize #=> "Yes"
  
== Named scopes

Booleanize will create two new named_scopes for each received attribute. Using the example given above, will have

* <tt>active</tt>  - Will return all the objects for which the <tt>active</tt> boolean attribute is true. It's equivalent to <tt>named_scope :active, :conditions => {:active => true}</tt>
* <tt>not_active</tt> - Will return all the objects for which the <tt>active</tt> boolean attribute is false. It's equivalent to <tt>named_scope :not-active, :conditions => {:active => false}</tt>
  
You can pass as many attributes to the <tt>booleanize</tt> method, either in the form of a symbol or as a three element array.

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    booleanize :active, [:smart, "Yes!", "No, dumb"], :friend
  end
  
== Resume

It's simple: Instead of writing this:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    named_scope :active, :conditions => {:active => true}
    named_scope :not_active, :conditions => {:active => false}
    
    def active_humanize
      active ? "Yes" : "No"
    end
    
    def active?
      active ? true : false  #=> because we'll always want it to return true or false, and never nil.
    end
  end  
  
You can simply write

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    booleanize [:active, "Yes", "No"]
  end
  
== Installation

Just clone the plugin inside <tt>RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins</tt>

  git clone git://github.com/cassiomarques/booleanize.git 
  
== Running the tests

Booleanize is a fully tested plugin. If you'd like to run the tests, you'll need:

* RSpec installed as a gem
* SQlite3
* SQlite3 Ruby adapter

Just enter the plugin's folder and run

  rake spec
  
And happilly watch all the tests pass (if everything needed for the tests is installed in your computer).
